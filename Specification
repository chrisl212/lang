1 Tokens
    Tokens are the smallest component of the pewter langauage. They are essentially the 'words' that make up the language's expressions. The following are the valid types
        - variable name (must begin with a letter)
        - keyword
        - function name
        - string literal
2 Expressions
    Expressions are groupings of tokens that serve some purpose. Expressions are ended with a newline character.
3 Functions
    Functions are groupings of expressions. A value may be returned from a function. The syntax for the declaration of a function is as follows

            def func(arg1 arg2)
                #function body goes here
            end

    A function is ended using the 'end' keyword. A function's name can be any valid ASCII character. The sytax to call a function is as follows

            [func arg1 arg2]
    pewter uses Polish-prefix notation to execute functions.

4 Variables
    Variables represent addresses in memory in which data can be stored. There are 4 basic variable types that are supplied by the language. These are strings, integers, arrays, and dictionaries. The syntax to declare a variable is as follows

            def varName

    The variable's type will not be decided until assignment; this type is not permament and can be changed if the variable is reassigned to another type.
5 Assignment
    A variable is assigned using the '=' character. The left side of this character must be a valid variable name and the right side must contain an expression that returns a value.

            def num = 3
            def str = "string"
            def ret = (func arg1 arg2)
